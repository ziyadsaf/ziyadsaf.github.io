## About Me

I am a software engineer with a First-Class BSc in Computing, focused on building Python applications, automation tools, and data-driven systems. I enjoy working on problems that involve debugging complex behaviour, designing reliable code, and turning prototypes into maintainable software.

My background includes building evaluation pipelines and automation tooling in Amazon’s AGI organisation, as well as developing personal projects across Python, machine learning, and frontend development.

This GitHub Pages site acts as a directory of my projects, while my portfolio website contains full project write-ups.
