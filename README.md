# 👋 Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

Hi! I'm Ziyad – a data science enthusiast with a First-Class Honours in BSc Computing, currently transitioning into the data analytics field. My background in Computer Science education and technical operations has equipped me with a solid foundation in data storytelling, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

This GitHub Pages site is where I share my data projects, learning journey, and analysis write-ups.

## 📊 Current Project

### 🎬 Movie Success Prediction and Analysis

**Objective**: Predict box office revenue based on metadata such as genre, budget, cast size, and release timing.

**Key Features**:
- Cleaned and explored a real-world movie dataset
- Performed feature engineering (e.g., log transformation of budget, encoding genres)
- Built and evaluated regression models using `scikit-learn`
- Visualised relationships and insights with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

**Tech Stack**:
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Skills in Progress

I'm currently upskilling in:

- Data Analysis with Python: Pandas, scikit-learn etc.
- Data Visualisation with Python: Matplotlib, Plotly, Folium, Dash
- Machine Learning concepts - regression, classification, random forest, decision tree, SVM


## 📚 Books I’m Reading

To deepen my theoretical foundation and applied skills, I'm actively working through the following:

- *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron  
- *Introduction to Statistical Learning* by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani  
- *Mathematics for Machine Learning* by Deisenroth, Faisal, and Ong  

These books help me explore key ML algorithms, understand statistical theory, and build intuition for working with real-world data.

## 🎯 What's Next?

More projects coming soon! Stay tuned as I continue exploring real-world data, building end-to-end machine learning pipelines, and applying statistical thinking to interesting challenges.
