## About

I am a software engineer with a First-Class BSc in Computing who enjoys building reliable software and learning how systems behave at scale. My experience includes developing Python automation and evaluation pipelines within Amazon’s AGI organisation, as well as building personal projects across backend development, data analysis, and frontend applications.

I am particularly interested in backend engineering, system reliability, and building tools that help teams move faster and make better decisions.
